    <div><p id="paraone">Bringing magic to life... <br><br>
    I decided to start this blog as a means of getting my writings and ideas out there into the world...
    first off, Im not what one would call your "typical" human, I believe in the strange and magical. 
    I believe in miracles and unconditional love.
I believe in things that most people would not even dare to dream about. I know these views are not always widely accepted,
but Im hoping that maybe, this will get out there to the people who are like myself :)
or better yet, help others who might need a little escape from the mundane activities of every day life,
 find a little magic to put into their day, too.</p></div>
